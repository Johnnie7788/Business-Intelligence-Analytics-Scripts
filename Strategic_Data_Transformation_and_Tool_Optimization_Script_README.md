# Strategic Data Transformation and Tool Optimization

## Overview

The **Strategic Data Transformation and Tool Optimization Framework** is a Python-based solution designed to:

- Assess current analytics infrastructure and identify gaps.
- Propose a strategic roadmap for data transformation.
- Evaluate and recommend BI tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, SAS) based on organizational needs.
- Create presentations and visualizations for effective stakeholder communication.

This framework is tailored for organizations aiming to optimize their data analytics processes and tools while aligning with strategic goals.
