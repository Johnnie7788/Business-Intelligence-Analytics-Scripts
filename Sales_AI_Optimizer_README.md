# Sales AI Optimizer 

## Overview

The Sales AI Optimizer Script is a machine learning-powered tool designed to help businesses analyze, predict, and optimize sales performance. This script processes key sales data—such as sales amounts, targets, regions, and salesperson performance—using techniques like Random Forest for predictive analysis and Prophet for time-series forecasting. It provides detailed insights and recommendations, enabling management to make data-driven decisions that improve overall sales efficiency.

## Cloud Integration

This script can be easily integrated with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for data storage, scalability, and the use of cloud-based AI/ML services. Cloud services like AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage can manage large datasets, while services like AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, or Google AI can be used for model training, deployment, and real-time predictions.

## Key Features Include:

- **Sales Performance Prediction:** Uses Random Forest Regressor to predict sales performance based on sales targets, regions, and time periods.
- **Salesperson and Regional Analysis:** Evaluates the performance of individual salespeople and regions, identifying areas for improvement and providing strategies to improve underperformers.
- **Sales Forecasting:** Implements Prophet for time-series forecasting, predicting future sales trends to guide decision-making.
- **Detailed Visualizations:** Generates visualizations of sales performance across regions and time periods, making it easier to identify trends and patterns.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Groups regions or salespeople into clusters to discover best practices from top performers and encourage knowledge-sharing across teams.
- **Professional Summary:** Provides a summary of sales performance with actionable recommendations for improving sales and optimizing sales strategies.

## Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Data Loading and Error Handling

The script loads the dataset from a CSV file and automatically handles missing values by filling them with the median for numerical columns. This ensures that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

### 2. Sales Performance Prediction

The script uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict the sales performance of a given salesperson or region based on:

- Sales Target (EUR)
- Sales Amount (EUR)
- Region
- Month
- Year

The model provides predictions that can help management evaluate whether a salesperson or region is on track to meet their sales targets.

### 3. Regional and Salesperson Performance Analysis

The script automatically calculates key performance metrics, such as:

- **Regional Performance:** Average sales performance across different regions.
- **Salesperson Performance:** Individual salesperson performance relative to their target, with recommendations for improvement.

### 4. Clustering for Best Practices

The script applies clustering (K-Means) to group regions or salespeople based on sales performance and targets, helping management identify high performers and areas for improvement.

### 5. Sales Forecasting

The script utilizes Prophet for time-series forecasting to predict future sales trends over the next 90 days. This helps businesses anticipate changes in sales and adjust strategies accordingly.

### 6. Visualizations

The script produces several key visualizations, such as:

- **Sales Performance Over Time by Country:** Shows how sales performance evolves across different regions.
- **Regional Clusters:** Visualizes the grouping of regions based on sales performance and targets.
- **Sales Forecast:** Predicts sales trends over time, helping management plan ahead.

### 7. Automatic Interpretation & Recommendations

For each analysis (e.g., sales performance, clustering, forecasting), the script automatically generates detailed interpretations and recommendations. This helps management understand current performance and provides actionable strategies for improvement.

### 8. Professional Summary & Next Steps

The script concludes with a high-level professional summary that includes:

- **Sales Performance Overview:** A summary of sales efficiency by region and salesperson.
- **Recommendations:** Actionable suggestions for improving sales performance, focusing on underperforming regions and individuals, and adopting best practices from top performers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:

- **Date:** The date of the sales transaction.
- **Country:** The country where the sales occurred.
- **Salesperson:** Name of the salesperson responsible for the sales.
- **Product Category:** The category of the product sold.
- **Sales Region:** The geographical region of the sales.
- **Month:** The month of the sales transaction.
- **Year:** The year of the sales transaction.
- **Sales Amount (EUR):** The actual amount of sales achieved by the salesperson.
- **Sales Target (EUR):** The target sales amount for the salesperson.

These columns help analyze sales performance across time, regions, and individuals, making it easier to identify trends and optimize performance.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn prophet
```

### 2. Prepare Your Dataset

Place your sales dataset in the root directory with the name `sales_data.csv`.

### 3. Run the Script

Execute the script to:

- **Predict Sales Performance:** Use the Random Forest Regressor to predict sales performance and analyze key sales metrics.
- **Analyze Sales by Region & Salesperson:** Automatically calculate regional performance, identify best practices, and provide strategies for improving sales.
- **Generate Business Strategies:** Automatically receive recommendations based on sales performance, regional efficiency, and salesperson output.

### 4. Review the Outputs

The script will generate:

- **Sales Performance Over Time:** Visual representation of sales performance trends across different regions.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Cluster regions or salespeople based on sales performance and sales targets.
- **Sales Forecast:** A time-series forecast of sales for the next 90 days.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For generating visualizations.
- **scikit-learn:** For machine learning models and clustering.
- **Prophet:** For time-series forecasting.
