    Detailed Insights and Managerial Recommendations:

    **1. Positive Sentiment ({pos_percentage:.2f}%):**
    - Customers are largely satisfied, indicating the product or service is generally well-received. 
    - **Managerial Action:**
        - **Upsell Opportunities:** Leverage this positivity by offering loyalty programs or exclusive promotions. This can further drive customer engagement and lifetime value.
        - **Brand Ambassadors:** Engage positive reviewers as brand ambassadors or for customer testimonials to reinforce trust and attract new customers.
        - **Referral Programs:** Consider launching referral campaigns, encouraging satisfied customers to bring new leads through word-of-mouth.

    **2. Negative Sentiment ({neg_percentage:.2f}%):**
    - The negative feedback indicates areas that require immediate attention to mitigate customer dissatisfaction.
    - **Managerial Action:**
        - **Root Cause Analysis:** Deep dive into negative reviews to identify the most frequent complaints. Categorize the issues (e.g., product quality, service response time, delivery delays) and prioritize corrective actions.
        - **Customer Recovery Strategy:** Implement a customer recovery strategy, offering proactive solutions such as refunds, discounts, or replacement products for affected customers. Communicate these efforts to regain trust.
        - **Process Improvement:** Consider addressing operational inefficiencies or quality control issues that contribute to negative reviews.
        - **Long-Term Improvement:** Ensure ongoing monitoring of negative reviews and implement systematic improvements in those areas over time to reduce future complaints.

    **3. Neutral Sentiment ({neu_percentage:.2f}%):**
    - Neutral reviews reflect indifference, which can indicate missed opportunities for deeper customer engagement.
    - **Managerial Action:**
        - **Customer Engagement:** Reach out to neutral reviewers through follow-up surveys to gather additional feedback. This will help to better understand their reservations and convert them into satisfied or loyal customers.
        - **Product Refinement:** Analyze the content of neutral reviews to determine if there are areas where expectations were met but not exceeded. Product enhancements based on neutral feedback can significantly boost overall satisfaction.
        - **Enhancing Customer Experience:** Neutral reviews may also suggest areas where personalization or a more tailored customer experience can improve satisfaction. Experiment with personalized offerings or more targeted communications.

    **Overall Strategic Recommendations:**
    - **Focus on Customer-Centric Initiatives:** High positive sentiment is a strong indicator of brand loyalty. Invest in nurturing these customers while addressing issues faced by those with negative or neutral experiences. Consider hosting online feedback sessions or using social listening tools to stay proactive in managing customer sentiment.
    - **Data-Driven Marketing:** Utilize sentiment insights in your marketing strategies. For example, create campaigns showcasing positive reviews to enhance brand reputation and promote features addressing common negative feedback points.
    - **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continue sentiment analysis on a regular basis to track shifts in customer opinion. This will enable management to make dynamic, data-driven decisions about product development, customer service, and overall business strategy.

If you're dealing with big datasets, the above approach can be scaled using PySpark for distributed processing. Here's how you would modify the code to use PySpark:

1. Initialize a Spark session:
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("AI_Driven_Sentiment_Analysis").getOrCreate()

2. Read large datasets:
    df_spark = spark.read.csv('AI-Driven_Customer_Sentiment_Analysis.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)

3. Use PySpark's ML library for sentiment scoring, preprocessing, and predictions:
    # Example for sentiment scoring using PySpark UDFs:
    from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
    from pyspark.sql.types import StringType, DoubleType

    sentiment_udf = udf(lambda text: SentimentIntensityAnalyzer().polarity_scores(text)['compound'], DoubleType())
    df_spark = df_spark.withColumn("Sentiment_Score", sentiment_udf(col("Processed_Review_Text")))

4. PySpark's MLlib could be used for building scalable models.
