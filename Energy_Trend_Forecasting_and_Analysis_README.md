# Energy Trend Forecasting and Analysis Script

## Overview
The **Energy_Trend_Forecaster_and_Analyzer** script analyzes and forecasts energy demand and fuel prices. It incorporates linear regression for analyzing the impact of macroeconomic factors and uses Prophet for time series forecasting of future energy demand. The ARIMA model is employed to forecast fuel commodity prices. The script is designed to provide actionable insights and recommendations for businesses based on trend analysis.

### Key features include:
1. **Energy Demand Trend Analysis**: Visualizes trends in energy demand and provides business recommendations based on observed patterns.
2. **Fundamental Driver Analysis**: Examines the impact of GDP growth and technology cost reductions on energy demand using linear regression.
3. **Energy Demand Forecasting**: Uses the Prophet model to predict future energy demand.
4. **Fuel Price Forecasting**: Uses the ARIMA model to forecast fuel commodity prices.
5. **Visualizations & Recommendations**: Provides graphical representations of trends and forecasts, along with professional recommendations based on the results.

## Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Data Loading and Error Handling
The script begins by reading energy data from a CSV file with error handling to manage potential issues like file misplacement or corrupted data.

### 2. Energy Demand Trend Analysis
This feature visualizes energy demand over time using line plots, while also interpreting the trend and making recommendations for capacity planning, investment in renewable energy, or efficiency improvements.

### 3. Fundamental Driver Analysis
Linear regression is used to assess the relationship between macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP growth and technology cost reductions, on energy demand. This helps to understand how external factors impact energy consumption.

### 4. Energy Demand Forecasting
The script employs the Prophet model to forecast future energy demand over a 12-month period. Visual forecasts help businesses plan for future capacity and investment in energy resources.

### 5. Fuel Price Forecasting
The ARIMA model is used to forecast future fuel prices based on historical data. The forecasts assist businesses in managing fuel cost volatility and optimizing their energy procurement strategies.

### 6. Data Visualization & Interpretation
The script generates the following visualizations:
1. **Energy Demand Trends Over Time**: A line plot showing energy demand patterns over time.
2. **Energy Demand Forecast**: A forecast plot for the next 12 months.
3. **Fuel Price Forecast**: A plot illustrating historical fuel prices with a 12-month forecast.

Each visualization is accompanied by an automated interpretation and recommendations for strategic decision-making.

## Dataset
This includes the energy data used for analysis, which consists of the following columns:
- **date**: Date of the energy event.
- **energy_demand (GWh)**: The energy demand in gigawatt-hours.
- **GDP_growth (%)**: Growth rate of the economy.
- **technology_cost_reduction (%)**: Percent reduction in technology costs.
- **fuel_price (USD/barrel)**: Price of fuel in USD per barrel.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Required Dependencies
Ensure that you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn prophet statsmodels
```

### 2. Prepare Your Dataset
Place your dataset in the root directory with the name `energy_data.csv`.

### 3. Run the Script
Execute the script to:
- Analyze trends in energy demand.
- Analyze the impact of fundamental drivers on energy demand.
- Forecast future energy demand and fuel prices.

### 4. Review the Outputs
The script will generate:
- **Energy Demand Trend Analysis**: A line plot visualizing energy demand trends over time, along with business recommendations based on observed patterns.
- **Energy Demand Forecast**: A forecast plot showing the predicted energy demand for the next 12 months, with strategic recommendations.
- **Fuel Price Forecast**: A forecast plot showing predicted fuel prices for the next 12 months, along with recommendations on how to manage fuel cost fluctuations.

## Libraries Used
