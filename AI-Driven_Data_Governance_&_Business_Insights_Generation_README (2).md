# AI-Driven Data Governance & Business Insights Generation

## Overview

The AI-Driven Data Governance & Business Insights Generation script is designed to analyze and improve key business performance indicators. It leverages machine learning models, including the Random Forest Classifier, to predict critical outcomes such as customer churn risk and overall business health. In addition, the script automatically generates interpretations and provides actionable strategies based on factors like Customer Satisfaction, Employee Satisfaction, and Sales Growth.

## Cloud Integration

This script can be connected to cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for data storage, scalability, and integration with cloud-based AI/ML services. Cloud storage services like AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage can handle larger datasets, while services like AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, or Google AI can be integrated for scalable model training, deployment, and real-time predictions.

## Key Features Include:

- **Churn Prediction**: Predicts customer churn risk using a Random Forest Classifier based on customer satisfaction, sales growth, product quality, and employee satisfaction.

- **Business Health Score**: Automatically calculates a composite business health score to assess the overall health of the business.

- **Feature Importance & Explanation**: Provides a breakdown of feature importance, explaining the key factors influencing churn and other business outcomes.

- **Detailed Visualizations & Interpretation**: Generates visual representations of key business metrics, with automatically generated interpretations to help understand the results.

- **Professional Summary**: Summarizes the model’s performance, including strategies for improving customer retention, employee engagement, and overall business health.

## Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Data Loading and Error Handling

The script loads business data from a CSV file and handles missing values by filling them with the median for numerical columns. This ensures that the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.

### 2. Churn Risk Prediction

The script uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn based on several business metrics, including:

- Customer Satisfaction Score
- Sales Growth Rate (%)
- Product Quality Score
- Employee Satisfaction Score
- Operational Cost (Thousands)
- Delivery Time (Days)
- Customer Lifetime Value (Thousands)
- Annual Revenue (Millions)
- Market Share (%)

The model predicts whether customers are likely to churn, and its accuracy is evaluated using metrics like Accuracy and Confusion Matrix.

### 3. Feature Importance & Explainability

The script generates a feature importance chart, explaining which factors contribute most to customer churn and business outcomes. This makes the model’s decisions transparent and easier to interpret.

### 4. Business Health Score Analysis

The script calculates a Business Health Score based on key business indicators (Customer Satisfaction, Sales Growth, Product Quality, Employee Satisfaction) to provide an overall assessment of business performance.

### 5. Visualizations

The script generates several visualizations, including:

- **Feature Importance Chart**: Highlights the features most important for churn prediction.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the model’s classification performance, showing true and false positives and negatives.

### 6. Automatic Interpretation & Recommendations

For each key result (e.g., churn prediction, business health score), the script automatically generates detailed interpretations and business-friendly recommendations. These help business leaders understand the state of the business and suggest strategies for improvement.

### 7. Professional Summary & Next Steps

The script concludes with a Professional Summary that includes:

- **Model performance**: A summary of the model’s accuracy and confusion matrix.
- **Strategies & Recommendations**: Actionable steps for improving customer retention, optimizing employee satisfaction, and addressing any high-risk areas identified in the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:

- **Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Customer_Satisfaction_Score**: Score from 1-100 representing how satisfied the customer is.
- **Sales_Growth_Rate_%**: Percentage indicating the sales growth for a customer.
- **Churn_Risk_Flag**: Binary flag (0 = no churn risk, 1 = high churn risk).
- **Product_Quality_Score**: Score from 1-100 representing the quality of products or services.
- **Employee_Satisfaction_Score**: Score from 1-100 indicating employee satisfaction.
- **Operational_Cost_Thousands**: Operational cost in thousands of dollars.
- **Delivery_Time_Days**: The number of days it takes to deliver products or services.
- **Customer_Lifetime_Value_Thousands**: The lifetime value of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Annual_Revenue_Millions**: The annual revenue generated in millions of dollars.
- **Market_Share_%**: Market share percentage held by the business.

These columns help analyze key business metrics such as customer satisfaction, churn risk, and employee engagement.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
