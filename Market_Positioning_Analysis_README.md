# Market Positioning Analysis Script

## Overview
This repository provides a script that performs Market Positioning Analysis by analyzing key business metrics such as **Market Share**, **Marketing Spend**, **Revenue**, and **Customer Sentiment**. The script employs **Linear Regression** to assess the relationship between Marketing Spend and Revenue, while **Prophet** is used for time series forecasting of future market share. The code also includes detailed visualizations and provides business insights based on the analysis results.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Market Share Analysis**: Provides interactive visualizations for understanding trends in market share over time.
- **Marketing Efficiency Analysis**: Analyzes the impact of marketing spend on revenue using **Linear Regression**.
- **Customer Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates customer satisfaction through sentiment scores and provides strategic recommendations.
- **Predictive Forecasting**: Uses the **Prophet** model to forecast market share trends.
- **Final Positioning Summary**: Provides a final analysis summarizing the company's position in the market (Leader, Stable, Needs Improvement) based on market share, marketing efficiency, and customer sentiment.

## Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
The script starts by loading the dataset `market_positioning_data.csv`. The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **Date**: The date of the data entry or event.
- **Company**: The name of the company being analyzed.
- **Market_Share (%)**: The percentage of market share held by the company.
- **Marketing_Spend (USD)**: The amount of money the company spent on marketing in USD.
- **Revenue (USD)**: The revenue generated by the company in USD.
- **Customer_Sentiment**: A score representing the level of customer satisfaction or sentiment towards the company, on a scale from 1 to 5.
- **Product_Innovations**: The number of new product innovations introduced by the company within the analysis period.
- **New_Customers**: The number of new customers acquired by the company during the analysis period.

### 2. Market Share Analysis
The script calculates the average **Market Share (%)** for each company and provides visualizations to track market share trends over time using **Plotly**. Business recommendations are provided based on the company's market share performance.

### 3. Marketing Efficiency Analysis
The **Marketing Spend vs Revenue** section uses **Linear Regression** to evaluate how marketing expenditure affects revenue. The coefficient of the regression model is analyzed to understand whether increased marketing spend leads to higher revenue.

### 4. Customer Sentiment Analysis
The script analyzes **Customer Sentiment** using **Seaborn** visualizations to display customer satisfaction across companies. Recommendations are automatically provided based on sentiment scores.

### 5. Predictive Market Share Forecasting
The **Prophet** model is used to forecast future market share trends for each company based on historical data. This helps businesses plan strategies based on predicted market movements.

### 6. Final Company Position
At the end of the analysis, the script summarizes each company's position as **Leader**, **Stable**, or **Needs Improvement**, based on:
- **Market Share**
- **Marketing Spend Efficiency**
- **Customer Sentiment**
  
These insights can be used for strategic decision-making to maintain or improve market positioning.
