# AI-Powered Project Management Intelligence Suite (AIPMIS)

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Project Management Intelligence Suite (AIPMIS)** is designed to analyze and optimize project management efficiency across multiple key project performance indicators. It leverages machine learning models, including the Random Forest Regressor, to predict project success metrics such as Progress Percentage. Additionally, it provides detailed automatic interpretations and strategies based on key project indicators like Cost Efficiency, Client Satisfaction, and Resource Efficiency, while accounting for project risks.

## Cloud Integration

This script can also be connected to cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for data storage, scalability, and integration with cloud-based AI/ML services. Cloud storage services like AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage can be used for handling larger datasets, while services like AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, or Google AI can be integrated for scalable model training, deployment, and real-time predictions.

## Key Features

- **Project Performance Prediction:** The script predicts project progress using the Random Forest Regressor model based on budget, team size, risks, and other project-specific features.
- **Cost Efficiency & Risk-Adjusted Performance Analysis:** Automatically calculates cost efficiency and risk-adjusted performance for each project, providing strategies for optimizing project management and resource allocation.
- **Detailed Visualizations & Interpretation:** Generates graphical representations of cost efficiency, profit per team member, client satisfaction, and more, with business-friendly interpretations.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain the contribution of each project feature to the predicted project outcomes.
- **Professional Summary:** Provides a detailed summary of project performance, including strategies for improving client satisfaction, managing high-risk projects, and optimizing resources.

## Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Data Loading and Error Handling
- The script loads project management data from a CSV file and handles missing values by filling them with the mean for numerical columns and the mode for categorical columns.

### 2. Project Performance Prediction
- Uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict project progress percentages based on metrics like:
    - Budget (USD)
    - Actual Cost (USD)
    - Team Size
    - Risks
    - Issues Count
    - Client Satisfaction (1-10)
    - Resource Utilization (%)
    - Duration (Days)
- Model accuracy is evaluated using RMSE.

### 3. Explainable AI with SHAP
- Integrates SHAP to provide explainable AI for predictions, offering transparency into how features contribute to project outcomes.

### 4. Cost Efficiency & Risk-Adjusted Performance Analysis
- Automatically calculates:
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Ratio of the project budget to the actual cost.
    - **Risk-Adjusted Performance**: Performance measure accounting for project risks.

### 5. Resource Efficiency and Profitability Analysis
- Insights into resource efficiency and profit generated per team member to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.

### 6. Visualizations
- Generates visualizations for:
    - **Cost Efficiency Distribution**
    - **Profit per Team Member**
    - **Client Satisfaction Distribution**
    - **Risk-Adjusted Performance**
    - **Resource Efficiency Score**

### 7. Automatic Interpretation & Recommendations
- Generates business interpretations and actionable recommendations for each project metric.

### 8. Professional Summary & Next Steps
- Provides an executive summary with recommendations for improving client satisfaction, optimizing resources, and addressing high-risk projects.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:
- ProjectID: Unique identifier for each project.
- ProjectName: The name of the project.
- StartDate: The project start date.
- EndDate: The project end date.
- Budget (USD): The budget allocated for the project.
- ActualCost (USD): The actual cost incurred by the project.
- TeamSize: The number of team members working on the project.
- ProgressPercentage (%): The current progress of the project, in percentage.
- Risks: A categorical assessment of project risks (e.g., high, medium, low).
- Issues (count): The number of issues encountered during the project.
- ClientSatisfaction (1-10): A client satisfaction rating for the project.
- Status: The current status of the project (e.g., completed, in progress, delayed).
- Resource Utilization (%): The percentage of resources being utilized effectively for the project.
- Profitability (USD): The profit generated by the project.
